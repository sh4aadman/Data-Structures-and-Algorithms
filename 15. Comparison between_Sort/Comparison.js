// Comparison between Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort

// For certain cases, like for a nearly sorted array ->

// Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort works faster.

// Selection Sort works slower, though all of them has O(n ^ 2) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

// Merge Sort and Quick Sort has O(n logn) time complexity along with the space complexity of O(n).

// Radix Sort has time complexity of O(n * k) and space complexity of O(n + k) - usually works faster than any other algorithms while sorting an array of numbers (integers) and binary strings.
