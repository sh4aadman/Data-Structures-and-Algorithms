// Linked Lists - contains head, tail, length property.

// Consists of nodes - each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.

// Comparison with Arrays - do not have indeces.

// Connected via nodes with a next pointer.

// Random access is not allowed.

// Where arrays are indexed in order - insertion and deletion can be expensive - can quickly be accessed at a specific index.

// Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning.

// The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes - Stacks and Queues.
